# Few-Shot Example Images

This folder should contain your few-shot example images for training the AI model.

## Required Images

Place the following images in this folder:

1. **fewshot1.jpg** - Example image showing train doors/exits scenario
2. **fewshot2.jpg** - Example image showing crowded train scenario
3. **fewshot3.jpg** - Example image showing train entry/doorway scenario

## Image Requirements

- Format: JPEG (.jpg)
- Size: Recommended 1280x720 or similar resolution
- Content: Should represent typical train navigation scenarios for visually impaired users

## Purpose

These images are used as training examples in the AI prompt to help the vision model understand:
- How to identify train doors and their status
- How to detect vacant seats
- How to assess crowd density
- How to provide navigation guidance

## Note

The application will still work without these images, but the AI responses may be less accurate. Make sure to add your own example images that match your specific use case.
